# Full Stack API Final Project

## Full Stack Trivia

It is an application to play quizzes by answering trivial questions and get your score back, The task for this project was to create and test APIs for the following functionalities:

1) Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer. 
2) Delete questions.
3) Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4) Search for questions based on a text query string.
5) Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category. 


## Getting Started
### Installing Dependencies

Developers using this project should have Python3, pip, node, and npm installed
it is recommended to work in vitrual environment

#### Backend Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, intsall dependencies by navigating to the `/backend`  directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Frontend Dependencies

This project uses NPM to manage software dependencies. NPM Relies on the package.json file located in the `/frontend` directory of this repository. After cloning, open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Frontend in Development mode

The frontend app was built using create-react-app. In order to run the app in development mode use ```npm start```. You can change the script in the ```package.json``` file.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

```bash
npm start
```

## Running the server

From within the `backend` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```
## Testing
To run the tests, run
```
dropdb trivia_test
createdb trivia_test
psql trivia_test < trivia.psql
python test_flaskr.py
```
## API Reference

### Getting Started
- Base URL: at this moment this app can only be run locally and is not hosted ass a base URL. The backend app is hosted at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
