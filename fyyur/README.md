Fyyur
-----

## Description

Fyyur is a musical venue and artist booking site that facilitates the discovery and bookings of shows between local performing artists and venues. This site lets you list new artists and venues, discover them, and list shows with artists as a venue owner.

My job was to build out the data models to power the API endpoints for the Fyyur site by connecting to a PostgreSQL database for storing, querying, and creating information about artists and venues on Fyyur.

## Functionality added

This app was nearly complete. It was only missing real data! While the views and controllers was defined in this application, it was missing models and model interactions to be able to store retrieve, and update data from a database. now, the site is capable of doing the following, using a PostgreSQL database:

* creating new venues, artists, and creating new shows.
* searching for venues and artists.
* learning more about a specific artist or venue.
